#E-commerce Web Application

This e-commerce platform provides a seamless experience for both sellers and buyers. Users can register as either a seller or a buyer, with sellers gaining the ability to post ads for their products and services. Buyers can browse through listings but cannot post ads.

Key Features:

Seller & Buyer Registration: Users can sign up as a seller or buyer, depending on their needs.
Ad Posting for Sellers: Only sellers are permitted to post ads, allowing them to showcase products or services.
Profile Management: Both sellers and buyers can easily edit their profiles, including changing their name, profile picture, and password.
Ad Management: Sellers have the ability to edit their ads before they are approved, ensuring that ads can be updated with the latest information before going live.
Forgot Password: Users can recover access to their accounts through a secure "Forgot Password" feature.
This platform is designed with user-friendliness in mind, making it easy for sellers to manage their ads and for buyers to explore available listings.
